This is a simple generative music synthesizer built in Max/MSP created by Diego Caponera, Nicolò Paternoster and Giuseppe Sorce. It involves 5 FM generators which play notes randomly based on a root key and intervals defined by the user. It’s an university project made for an exam for Sound’s Science degree (Math Department of Roma Tor Vergata).

The software is distributed “as is”, without any warranty, under a GPL license.

Features:

* Glitchy palette of sounds
* Change notes with MIDI (from clips and/or controllers)
* Switch Harmonic/Dissonant to avoid dissonant chords
* Clock synced
* Fully MIDI mappable
* Glide!

This is the port of the original SMILE application, plus additional features. Grab the .zip from googlecode to get some presets as well: http://code.google.com/p/smilesynth/
